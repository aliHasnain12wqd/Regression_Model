# Regression Model

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that builds a regression model using TensorFlow/Keras for top-K retrieval based on user features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a regression model that predicts certain target variables based on user input features. This model is built with TensorFlow and is intended for tasks where accurate top-K retrieval is needed.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Proper preprocessing steps for input data to make it suitable for model training.
- **Model Building:** Implementation of a regression model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Training & Validation:** The model is trained using a specified loss function and optimizer, with validation on a test dataset.
- **Top-K Retrieval:** The model supports retrieving the top-K predictions for a given input.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook file `Regression Model.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data, build the regression model, and generate predictions.
3. Customize the model architecture or preprocessing steps as needed for your specific task.

## File Structure

- `Regression Model.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: (Optional) Folder to store your dataset files.
- `models/`: (Optional) Folder to save trained models.

## Model Details

The regression model uses a simple feedforward neural network architecture, which can be easily modified. Here's a summary of the model components:
- **Input:** User features.
- **Output:** Regression output that can be used for tasks such as predicting continuous variables.

## Future Work

- Optimize the model architecture for better performance.
- Experiment with different loss functions.
- Add support for categorical features in the input data.
- Improve top-K retrieval accuracy.
